# IMPROVED-INTRO-COMPONENT-WITH-SIGN-UP-FORM

This is my "Intro component with sign-up form" project (Frontend Mentor).

Hi! welcome to my second Fontend Mentor's project. It has been coded mobile first using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Just for fun and to test some more JS skills i decided to add few more validation features:

1) First and Last Name validation - the form validates them checking if they're composed only by spaces, by just one character, by more than 50 letters
2) Email validation - the form validates if it's composed only by spaces or it's not a valid email
3) Password validation - the form validates if it's composed only by spaces or it's not a valid password (it must be composed by at least 8 characters, 1 uppercase letter, 1 lowercase letter, 1 digit, 1 special character)

If one (or more) of the insertions are not compliant the submission fails and error messages (different for each type of error) are exposed as required.
If the insertions are compliant the form is submitted: there's a submission like simulation in the code (not AJAX but just a simple type of promises' use to test them - im'learning them just right now).

Let me know what you think about it and how can be improved in your opinions: suggestions are welcome.

Thanks

Giacomo
